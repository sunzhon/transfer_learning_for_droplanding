Routines for working with vectors
These routines can be used with vectors, as well as with matrices containing a vector in each row.

Functions
---------

* :func:`vector.angle` ... Angle between two vectors
* :func:`vector.GramSchmidt` ... Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of three points
* :func:`vector.normalize` ... Normalization of a vector
* :func:`vector.project` ... Projection of one vector onto another
* :func:`vector.plane_orientation` ... Orientation of plane defined by three points
* :func:`vector.q_shortest_rotation` ... Quaternion indicating the shortest rotation from one vector into another.
* :func:`vector.rotate_vector` ... Rotation of a vector
* :func:`vector.target2orient` ... Convert target location into orientation angles
